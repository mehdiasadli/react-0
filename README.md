# React-0

React-0 is a skeleton project for creating React projects from scratch. It provides a basic structure for organizing your project files and folders, making it easier to get started with building your own React application. It is created by [Mehdi Asadli](https://github.com/mehdiasadli). It was started with VITE (4.1.0).

## It also includes serveral dependencies

- `react` and `react-dom`
- `react-router-dom`
- `axios` and `react-query`
- `styled-components` and `antd`
- `react-helmet-async`
- `react-hook-form`
- `react-redux`

## Project Structure
The project structure is organized into several folders:

### `src/`
The `src/` folder is the root folder of the project, and it contains all the source code files for your application. The subfolders inside `src/` are:

### `app/`
The `app/` folder contains the main components of the application, including `components/`, `elements/`, and `pages/`.

- `components/` folder contains the reusable components of the application.
- `elements/` folder contains the small components of the application, such as `Input`, `Button`, `Title`, etc.
- `pages/` folder contains the pages of the application.

### `assets/`
The `assets/` folder contains all the static assets, such as images, fonts, and stylesheets.

### `hooks/`
The `hooks/` folder contains custom hooks that can be reused throughout the application.

### `resources/`
The `resources/` folder contains global constants and data that can be accessed throughout the application.

### `services/`
The `services/` folder contains modules for communicating with APIs.

### `utils/`
The `utils/` folder contains utility and helper functions that can be reused throughout the application.

### `index.css`
The `index.css` file contains the global styles for the application.

### `main.jsx`
The `main.jsx` file is the entry point of the application, where the `App` component is rendered.

## Getting Started
To get started with React-0, you can clone this repository and start building your own React application. You can modify the existing components or create new ones inside the `app/` folder, and add your own stylesheets, assets, and utility functions.
